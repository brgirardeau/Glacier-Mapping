Matching a plane to glacier elevation data in Greenland. 

This program takes NASA ICESat data points of the Jakobshavn glacier in Greenland and divides them in to grids. Each grid is then fit to a plane, giving a general idea of the shape of the glacier that can be compared from year to year to see a change in glacier ice sheet volume. 

It was created for a high school Multivariable Calculus project.
